        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Phryge takes the shape and form of a Phrygian cap. As Paris 2024's vision is to demonstrate that sport can change lives, the mascots will be playing a major role by leading a revolution through sport. The Olympic Phryge is decked out in blue, white and red - the colours of Franceâ€™s famed tricolor flag - with the golden Paris 2024 logo emblazoned across its chest.</p>

        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>Originating from ancient Phrygia, a region in modern-day Turkey, the cap was adopted by freed slaves in ancient Rome as a mark of their emancipation. During the French Revolution, it became an emblem of the revolutionaries and was worn as a symbol of resistance against oppression. The cap is often depicted in artwork and on historical monuments, such as the famous statue of Marianne, which represents the French Republic.</p>
